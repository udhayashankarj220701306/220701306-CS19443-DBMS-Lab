## Expense Manager 💸
This project involves the creation of an Expense Manager application
using Python, with PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI) and
Pyrebase for Firebase integration. The application aims to provide users
with an efficient and user-friendly platform to track and manage their daily
expenses. Firebase's Realtime Database is utilized to store and synchronize
expense data in real-time, ensuring users have up-to-date access to their
financial information across multiple devices. Key features include secure
user authentication, expense tracking with detailed entry fields, and data
visualization.
The integration of Pyrebase simplifies interaction with Firebase services,
allowing for seamless authentication, real-time data updates, and
consistent synchronization. Users can add, edit, delete, search, and filter
expenses, with changes instantly reflected across all devices. By
combining PyQt5's robust GUI capabilities with Firebase's powerful
backend services, this Expense Manager application provides a
comprehensive solution for personal finance management.
